1000 In the tapestry of the universe, stars are born and die,
0100 galaxies spin in the silent waltz of space,
0010 while black holes weave the fabric of spacetime.
1100 On Earth, the ebb and flow of oceans
1010 echo the rhythm of lunar cycles.
0110 Forests grow, inhaling carbon, exhaling life,
0001 nurturing biodiversity in their leafy realms.
1001 Cities pulse with the beat of human endeavor,
0101 innovation blossoms from necessity and imagination.
0011 Art and culture reflect the diversity of human experience,
1110 telling stories that resonate across ages.
1011 Mathematics underpins the chaos with order,
0111 its equations the language of the cosmos.
0000 The digital realm expands, a new dimension of existence,
1101 where virtual and physical realities blur.
