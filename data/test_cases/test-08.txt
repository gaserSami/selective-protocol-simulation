0001 Poetry of the cosmos, written in starlight,
1001 invites us to read its ancient verses.
0101 While the microcosm, in its complexity,
0011 mirrors the majesty of the macrocosm.
1110 Our planet spins, a blue jewel in the vastness,
1010 an oasis of life, precious and fragile.
0111 Through the lens of history, we see our place,
0001 transient yet capable of leaving lasting legacies.
1001 As we stand looking up at the stars,
0101 we understand that this moment is but a brief chapter.
0010 In the grand story of the universe,
1111 we are both the authors and the audience.
